# This a custom proto created using Smartmicro UMR-A0 type 29 sensor model based on the Radar node.
# The camera node have no role in the sensor value.The sensor value only depend upon the orientation of sensor in the Farm environment
# This model was used to get soil PH of soil node present in the Farm environment.
